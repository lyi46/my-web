    <h1>How it all started...</h1>

    <p>My story begins in my early high-school days, when lectures would get occasionally boring, and I’d pick up a pen. When there weren’t any papers around to scribble on, my hand would become the victim of my boredom. The little doodles born from my Statistics class bloomed into a love for calligraphy and art. Soon after, I graduated from my hand and was gifted with my now-beloved iPad Pro. By experimenting with Procreate on my iPad, I discovered a new world of possibilities along with a passion for digital art, and it only took off from there.</p>

    <p>Over my journey, I have realized that drawing holds multiple meanings to me. It’s a language, a creative outlet, and a form of storytelling. It gives me the ability to capture a scene and tell an introduction to a story, letting the viewer interpret the ending for themselves through their lens. Despite my short-lived attention span, drawing is one of the few things that brings me into deep focus. This is because, with every piece I have created and will create, I learn something new, whether it’s discovering a new combination of colors, the intricacy of shadows and highlights of a hand, or an appreciation of the delicate and beautiful relationship between humans and the world.</p>

    <p>When beginning my first year of college, I took a beginner Python class. Having the presumption that my brain was wired on the artistic side, I had no expectations nor interest to venture into such a technical field. I proved myself wrong when I learned coding was a similar process to art. Although the learning curve was a bit more challenging, it was also a creative outlet, a form of storytelling, and (ironically) a new, literal language through which I could communicate. I discovered a different way to create something out of nothing, finding joy in designing elegant algorithms, much like sketching the first lines of a drawing. Coding has taught me that creativity knows no bounds and that even the most logical structures can possess beauty and narrative. Here marked the beginning of another passion.</p>

    <p>Drawing and coding are a reflection of my evolving style and my endless curiosity about creating. I hope to explore the endless possibilities where these two passions intersect. I am thrilled to share it with you and hope it resonates with you as deeply as it does with me.</p>

    <p class="highlight">Thank you for joining me on this creative adventure. Welcome to my world of art and coding!</p>
