        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p>My rationale for building this website is to learn html, css, and the process of building and styling websites. To make my website visually appealing, I selected my own png as the background. I have had a little experience with html and github. I made a previous <a href="https://lindseyyii.github.io/My-Portfolio/" target="_blank">website</a> (importing pdfs) that can be found at this link. Click to view my main/updated <a href="www.lindseyyi.com" target="_blank">portfolio</a> website. This website was made with a website builder and not with any code.</p>
